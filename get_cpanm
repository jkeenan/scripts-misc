# Installs 'cpanm' against a newly installed perl

# Prerequisite: wget

# Run this from the top level of a perl installed for testing purposes,
# i.e., a directory under which you have, at a minimum:
#    ./bin
#    ./bin/perl
#    ./lib

# After installation, cd to that top-level directory and start installing CPAN
# modules against that perl
#
#   ./bin/cpanm List::Compare Text::CSV::Hashify

# Adapted from Florian Ragwitz and Karl Williamson
